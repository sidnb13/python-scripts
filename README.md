# python-scripts

Various python scripts.

## go-to-teams

Uses selenium to navigate to TEAMS to check grades. Automatically logs in based on username/password given in a `config.ini` file (mostly useless, just to try out the selenium module).

## college-info-scraper

Uses selenium, BeautifulSoup, and requests to scrape a college's information from its page on US News and World Report and output the info to a CSV file. Input is taken from a text file of URLs. Is sometimes unreliable as the site is dynamic.

## misc

Mostly useless or deprecated scripts still kept around.
